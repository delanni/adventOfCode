# Advent of Code (a polyglot approach)

Here should be solutions for advent of code (http://adventofcode.com/) in various languages.

This is not a demonstration of my polyglotism. On the contrary: I'm just trying to pick up some of these languages.

The point of this project is for me to practise the usage of these languages, over this neat set of tasks.

Status of languages:
* Javascript: *25/25*
* R:          *10/25*
* Python:     *0/25*
* C++:        *0/25*
